          <p>Hello, my name is Sonia Pandit. I am a former Paralegal specializing in Contracts, Business, and Civil Litigation. 
             My love of learning truly began after I started reading and wanted to understand the true purpose and meaning of life.
             Thus, began my rapid growth and, I was able to start college at the age of Sixteen. I originally had a passion for studying Microbiology and
             Artifical Intelligence, however due to some setbacks, I was unable to continue in that discipline. Rather, I pursued my 
             dual degree in Law and Sociology from UC Santa Cruz. </p>
